Shader class
    descriptors, layout, inputs, outputs, dispatch

Floodfill shader (input output texture feedback)
Diffusion Shader

2D fluid sim

Ray march shader

3D shaders

3D Stable Fluids
--- THIS WEEK

Geometry Rendering
Fluid boundaries with geometry

Fluid subdivide (use mipmap or texture arrays to have LOD)
Priority subdivide around geometry and high turbulence fluid

Transform Geometry -> Update Grid -> Solve Fluid -> Integrate Force -> Render Fluid

per-cell
vec3 velocity
vec3 density

Potential Engineering Discussions
SSBO vs. 3DTextures vs. UBO, try all 3 and report differences

Optimize data layout (textures (packed/combined), vs buffers, structs etc.)

Runge Kutta integration
